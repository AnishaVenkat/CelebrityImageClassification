# CelebrityImageClassification
In this project I have built an end to end application which classifies the celebrity image based on facial features

Here we classify sports personalities. We restrict classification to only 5 people,
1) Maria Sharapova
2) Serena Williams
3) Virat Kohli
4) Roger Federer
5) Lionel Messi

We have used  opencv haar cascade to detect faces , where if face is not properly visible it would be discarded, and Wavelet transform to identify the features of each image and various machine learning models are applied for model building.

SVC model accuracy:82%

Technologies used in this project,
1. Python
2. Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
